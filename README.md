# Deep-Learning-for-DeepDream
DeepDream is an experiment that visualizes the patterns learned by a neural network. Similar to when a child watches clouds and tries to interpret random shapes, DeepDream over-interprets and enhances the patterns it sees in an image.

## DeepDream
This is one of the interesting applications of deep learning in computer vision. It is actually a computer program that was developed by Google engineer Alexender Mordvintsev. This program uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance image patterns using algorithmic pareidolia. It creates dream-like hallucinogenic visualizations in the processed images. This model has been applied in the field of art history. Also, it has been used by researchers to allow users to explore virtual reality environments to mimic the experience of psychoactive substances.
